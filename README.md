## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Code

The `smartcab/agent.py` python file implements reinforcement learning to train the smartcab to safely and quickly navigate from origin to destination. Supporting python code to generate a driving environment, environmental simulaiton, etc. can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute the smartcab agent code.
